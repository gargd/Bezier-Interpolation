# Bezier-Interpolation-for-VTK
For all 1-D,2-D and 3-D Bezier patches.

The function InterpolateOnPatch takes control points as inputs and interpolates them so that it can represent the final Bezier curve.I have defined the data structures as vtkDataArray so that if it clears all the test cases,it can be merged with VTK and use its already present vtkDataArray class.
